##mod_prebind - BOSH Pre-binding

####based on:

@skeltoac's [http_prebind](https://github.com/skeltoac/http_prebind)

@thepug's [Mod-Http-Pre-Bind](https://github.com/thepug/Mod-Http-Pre-Bind)

**DISCLAIMER: I don't _really_ know erlang**

**This code is by no means ready for production.**
At the moment it basically allows BOSH pre-bindings for any registered users that have a known password as a HTTP POST request.
A more advace token processing solution should be available soon...
